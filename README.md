# AI Image Classifier 

This project is part of the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program offered by Udacity. It focuses on developing an AI image classifier using deep learning techniques. The trained classifier is capable of recognizing different species of flowers. The application can be used to identify flowers by providing an image.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following steps:

1. **Load and Preprocess the Image Dataset**: The image dataset containing flower images is loaded and preprocessed before training the classifier. This step involves resizing, normalizing, and transforming the images to ensure compatibility with the deep learning model.

2. **Train the Image Classifier**: The preprocessed dataset is used to train the image classifier. A deep learning model, specifically a convolutional neural network (CNN), is trained on the dataset using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent. The model learns to recognize patterns and features in the flower images.

3. **Use the Trained Classifier to Predict Image Content**: After training the classifier, it can be used to predict the content of new flower images. The trained model takes an input image and outputs the predicted flower species along with a confidence score.

## Dependencies

The following packages and libraries are required to run the AI image classifier:

- Python (version X.X.X): The application is developed using the Python programming language. Please ensure that Python is installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website.

- PyTorch: PyTorch is a popular deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks. Install PyTorch using the official installation instructions specific to your system. The AI image classifier relies on PyTorch for training the CNN model and making predictions.

- torchvision: torchvision is a PyTorch library that provides various utilities and datasets for computer vision tasks. Install torchvision using the official installation instructions specific to your system. The AI image classifier uses torchvision for image transformations, dataset loading, and model architecture.

- matplotlib: matplotlib is a plotting library used to visualize the training progress and display the predicted flower species along with the confidence score. Install matplotlib using the official installation instructions specific to your system.

- numpy: numpy is a numerical computing library used for handling arrays and mathematical operations. It is a dependency of PyTorch and should be automatically installed when installing PyTorch.

## Usage

To use the AI image classifier, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files provided by Udacity.

2. Install the necessary dependencies mentioned in the "Dependencies" section. Make sure to install the correct versions compatible with your system.

3. Run the Python script containing the image classifier code. Ensure that the script file and the dataset are in the same directory.

4. The script will load and preprocess the image dataset, train the image classifier, and save the trained model parameters.

5. After training, you can use the trained classifier to predict the species of flower in new images. Simply provide the path to the image in the script, and it will output the predicted flower species and confidence score.

## Additional Notes

- The dataset used for training the image classifier consists of 102 flower categories. However, you can modify the script to work with your own dataset by making appropriate changes to the dataset loading and preprocessing steps.

- The accuracy and performance of the image classifier may vary depending on factors such as the size and quality of the training dataset, the complexity of the flower species, and the chosen model architecture.

- Feel free to experiment with different hyperparameters, model architectures, and training techniques to improve the accuracy and performance of the image classifier.

- Make sure to comply with any applicable licensing or usage restrictions when using the flower dataset or any other external resources.
